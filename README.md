# Console-Finances

Javascript app to analyse the finances of a company using console.

## Description 

This app generates financial analysis in the console log referring to a 2D array including months and profit/loss per month. 

It generates :

    *The total number of months / entries in the dataset

    *The net total amount of the profit/losses over the entire period/ 

    *The average of the changes or differences in profit / loss over the entire period/ 

    *The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

    *The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

When you open the console, the analysis is laid out in this order in the form of a list.

The app uses Javascript to analyse the data using 'for' loops and 'if' statements. 

It also uses the function math.floor to round to the nearest 100th.
